# String processing

One of the most common data wrangling challenges involves extracting
numeric data contained in character strings and converting them into the
numeric representations required to make plots, compute summaries, or
fit models in R. Also common is processing unorganized text into
meaningful variable names or categorical variables. Many of the string
processing challenges a data scientist faces are unique and often
unexpected. It is therefore quite ambitious to write a comprehensive
section on this topic. Here we use a series of case studies that help us
demonstrate how string processing is a necessary step for many data
wrangling challenges. Specifically, we describe the process of
converting the original, *raw* data from which we extracted
the `murders`, `heights`, and `research_funding_rates` examples into the
data frames we have studied in this book.

By going over these case studies, we will cover some of the most common
tasks in string processing including extracting numbers from strings,
removing unwanted characters from text, finding and replacing
characters, extracting specific parts of strings, converting free form
text to more uniform formats, and splitting strings into multiple
values.

Base R includes functions to perform many of these tasks. The **stringi**
package adds significant functionality over what is available in base R,
especially for complex and diverse text processing needs. The **stringr** package provides
consistent, simple, and user friendly wrappers around the **stringi**
package. For example, in **stringr**, all the string processing
functions start with `str_`. This means that if you type `str_` and hit
tab, R will auto-complete and show all the available functions. As a
result, we don't necessarily have to memorize all the function names.
Another advantage is that in the functions in this package the string
being processed is always the first argument, which means we can more
easily use the pipe. Therefore, we will start by describing how to use
the functions in the **stringr** package.

Most of the examples will come from the second case study which deals
with self-reported heights by students, and most of the chapter is
dedicated to learning regular expressions (regex) and functions in the
**stringr** package.

## The stringr package {#sec-stringr}

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
```

In general, string processing tasks can be divided into **detecting**,
**locating**, **extracting**, or **replacing** patterns in strings. We
will see several examples. The table below includes the functions
available to you in the **stringr** package. We split them by task. We
also include the base R equivalent when available.

All these functions take a character vector as first argument. Also, for
each function, operations are vectorized: the operation gets applied to
each string in the vector.

Finally, we mention *groups* in this table. These will be
explained in @sec-groups.

## Case study 1: self-reported heights

The **dslabs** package includes the raw data from which the heights
dataset was obtained. You can load it like this:

```{r, cache=FALSE}
library(dslabs)
head(reported_heights)
```

These heights were obtained using a web form in which students were
asked to enter their heights. They could enter anything, but the
instructions asked for *height in inches*, a number. We compiled
`r prettyNum(nrow(reported_heights), big.mark=",")` submissions, but
unfortunately the column vector with the reported heights had several
non-numeric entries and as a result became a character vector:

```{r}
class(reported_heights$height)
```

If we try to parse it into numbers, we get a warning:

```{r}
x <- as.numeric(reported_heights$height)
```

Although most values appear to be height in inches as requested we do
end up with many `NA`s:

```{r}
sum(is.na(x))
```

Here are some of the entries that are not successfully converted:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
reported_heights |> 
  mutate(new_height = as.numeric(height)) |>
  filter(is.na(new_height)) |> 
  head(n = 10)
```

We immediately see what is happening. Some of the students did not
report their heights in inches as requested. We could discard these data
and continue. However, many of the entries follow patterns that, in
principle, we can easily convert to inches. For example, in the output
above, we see various cases that use the format `x'y"` or `x'y''` with `x` and `y`
representing feet and inches, respectively. Each one of these cases can
be read and converted to inches by a human, for example `5'4"` is
`5*12 + 4 = 64`. So we could fix all the problematic entries *by hand*.
However, humans are prone to making mistakes, so an automated approach
is preferable. Also, because we plan on continuing to collect data, it
will be convenient to write code that automatically corrects entries
entered in error.

A first step in this type of task is to survey the problematic entries
and try to define specific patterns followed by a large groups of
entries. The larger these groups, the more entries we can fix with a
single programmatic approach. We want to find patterns that can be
accurately described with a rule, such as "a digit, followed by a feet
symbol, followed by one or two digits, followed by an inches symbol".

To look for such patterns, it helps to remove the entries that are
consistent with being in inches and to view only the problematic
entries. We thus write a function to automatically do this. We keep
entries that either result in `NA`s when applying `as.numeric` or are
outside a range of plausible heights. We permit a range that covers
about 99.9999% of the adult population. We also use `suppressWarnings`
to avoid the warning message we know `as.numeric` will gives us.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
alpha <- 1 / 10^6
qnorm(1 - alpha / 2, 69.1, 2.9)
qnorm(alpha / 2, 63.7, 2.7)
```

We apply this function and find the number of problematic entries:

```{r}
problems <- reported_heights |> 
  mutate(inches = suppressWarnings(as.numeric(height))) |>
  filter(is.na(inches) | inches < 50 | inches > 84) |>
  pull(height)
length(problems)
```

We can now view all the cases by simply printing them. If we do, we see
that three patterns can be used to define three large groups within these exceptions.

1\. A pattern of the form `x'y` or `x' y''` or `x'y"` with `x` and `y`
representing feet and inches, respectively. Here are ten examples:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pattern <- "^\\d\\s*'\\s*\\d{1,2}\\.*\\d*'*\"*$"
str_subset(problems, pattern) |> head(n = 10) |> cat()
```

2\. A pattern of the form `x.y` or `x,y` with `x` feet and `y` inches.
Here are ten examples:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pattern <- "^[4-6]\\s*[\\.|,]\\s*([0-9]|10|11)$"
str_subset(problems, pattern) |> head(n = 10) |> cat()
```

3\. Entries that were reported in centimeters rather than inches. Here
are ten examples:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ind <- which(between(suppressWarnings(as.numeric(problems))/2.54, 54, 81) )
ind <- ind[!is.na(ind)]
problems[ind] |> head(n = 10) |> cat()
```

Once we see these large groups following specific patterns, we can
develop a plan of attack.

1.  Convert entries fitting the first two patterns into one standardized
    one.
2.  Leverage the standardization to extract the feet and inches and
    convert to inches.
3.  Define a procedure for identifying entries that are in centimeters
    and convert them to inches.
4.  Check again to see what entries were not fixed and see if we can
    tweak our approach to be more comprehensive.

At the end, we hope to have a script that makes web-based data
collection methods robust to the most common user mistakes.

Remember that there is rarely just one way to perform these tasks. Here
we pick one that helps us teach several useful techniques. But surely
there is a more efficient way of performing the task.

To achieve our goal, we will use a technique that enables us to
accurately detect patterns and extract the parts we want: *regular
expressions* (regex). But first, we quickly describe how to *escape* the
function of certain characters so that they can be included in strings.

## Escaping

To define strings in R, we can use either double quotes or single
quotes:

```{r}
s <- "Hello!"
s <- 'Hello!' 
```

Make sure you choose the correct single quote, as opposed to the back
quote `` ` ``.

Now, what happens if the string we want to define includes double
quotes? For example, if we want to write 10 inches like this `10"`? In
this case you can't use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
s <- "10""
```

because this is just the string `10` followed by a double quote. If you
type this into R, you get an error because you failed to close the
double quote. To avoid this, we can use the single quotes:

```{r}
s <- '10"'
```

If we print out `s` we see that the double quotes are *escaped* with the
backslash `\`.

```{r}
s
```

In fact, escaping with the backslash provides a way to define the string
while still using the double quotes to define strings:

```{r}
s <- "10\""
```

In R, the function `cat` lets us see what the string actually looks
like:

```{r}
cat(s)
```

Now, what if we want our string to be 5 feet written like this `5'`? In
this case, we can use the double quotes or escape the single quote

```{r}
s <- "5'"
s <- '5\''
```

So we've learned how to write 5 feet and 10 inches separately, but what
if we want to write them together to represent *5 feet and 10 inches*
like this `5'10"`? In this case, neither the single nor double quotes
will work since `'5'10"'` closes the string after 5 and this `"5'10""`
closes the string after 10. Keep in mind that if we type one of the
above code snippets into R, it will get stuck waiting for you to close
the open quote and you will have to exit the execution with the *esc*
button.

To achieve the desired result we need to escape both quotes with the
backslash `\`. You can escape either character that can be confused with
a closing quote. These are the two options:

```{r}
s <- '5\'10"'
s <- "5'10\""
```

Escaping characters is something we often have to use when processing
strings. Another characters that often needs escaping is the backslash
character itself. We can do this with `\\`. When using regular
expression, the topic of the next section, we often have to escape the
*special characters* used in this approach.

## Regular expressions {#sec-regex}

A regular expression (regex) is a way to describe specific patterns of
characters of text. They can be used to determine if a given string
matches the pattern. A set of rules has been defined to do this
efficiently and precisely and here we show some examples. We can learn
more about these rules by reading a detailed
tutorials[^string-processing-1] [^string-processing-2]. The RStudio
cheat sheet for __stringr__ and regular expression[^string-processing-3] is also very useful.

[^string-processing-1]: <https://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html>

[^string-processing-2]: <http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html#matching-patterns-with-regular-expressions>

[^string-processing-3]: <https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/strings.pdf>

The patterns supplied to the **stringr** functions can be a regex rather
than a standard string. We will learn how this works through a series of
examples.

Throughout this section you will see that we create strings to test out
our regex. To do this, we define patterns that we know should match and
also patterns that we know should not. We will call them `yes` and `no`,
respectively. This permits us to check for the two types of errors:
failing to match and incorrectly matching.

### Strings are a regex

Technically any string is a regex, perhaps the simplest example is a
single character. So the comma `,` used in the next code example is a
simple example of searching with regex.

```{r}
pattern <- ","
str_detect(c("1", "10", "100", "1,000", "10,000"), pattern) 
```

Above, we noted that an entry included a `cm`. This is also a simple
example of a regex. We can show all the entries that used `cm` like
this:

```{r}
str_subset(reported_heights$height, "cm")
```

### Special characters

Now let's consider a slightly more complicated example. Which of the
following strings contain the pattern `cm` or `inches`?

```{r}
yes <- c("180 cm", "70 inches")
no <- c("180", "70''")
s <- c(yes, no)
```

We can do this with two searches:

```{r}
str_detect(s, "cm") | str_detect(s, "inches")
```

However, we don't need to do this. The main feature that distinguishes
the regex *language* from plain strings is that we can use special
characters. These are characters with a meaning. We start by introducing
`|` which means *or*. So if we want to know if either `cm` or `inches`
appears in the strings, we can use the regex `cm|inches`:

```{r}
str_detect(s, "cm|inches")
```

and obtain the correct answer.

Another special character that will be useful for identifying feet and
inches values is `\d` which means any digit: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9. The backslash is used to distinguish it from the character `d`. In R,
we have to *escape* the backslash `\` so we actually have to use `\\d`
to represent digits. Here is an example:

```{r}
yes <- c("5", "6", "5'10", "5 feet", "4'11")
no <- c("", ".", "Five", "six")
s <- c(yes, no)
pattern <- "\\d"
str_detect(s, pattern)
```

We take this opportunity to introduce the `str_view` function, which is
helpful for troubleshooting as it shows us all matches for each
string that has matches. Each match is surrounded by the characters `<` and `>`. Below, we see that `5` has one match
and `5'10` has three matches.

```{r eval = FALSE}
str_view(s, pattern)
```
![](img/str_view-1.png){width="80%"}

To view all strings, even if there wasn't a match, we can use the `match = NA` parameter.

```{r eval = FALSE}
str_view(s, pattern, match = NA)
```

![](img/str_view-2.png){width="80%"}

Another useful special character is `\w` which stands for *word
character* and it matches any letter, number, or underscore.


There are many other special characters. We will learn some others
below, but you can see most or all of them in the cheat
sheet[^string-processing-3] mentioned earlier.

### Character classes

Character classes are used to define a series of characters that can be
matched. We define character classes with square brackets `[]`. So, for
example, if we want the pattern to match only if we have a `5` or a `6`,
we use the regex `[56]`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
str_view(s, "[56]", match = NA)
```

![](img/str_view-3.png){width="80%"}


Suppose we want to match values between 4 and 7. A common way to define
character classes is with ranges. So, for example, `[0-9]` is equivalent
to `\\d`. The pattern we want is therefore `[4-7]`.

```{r}
yes <- as.character(4:7)
no <- as.character(1:3)
s <- c(yes, no)
str_detect(s, "[4-7]")
```

However, it is important to know that in regex everything is a
character; there are no numbers. So `4` is the character `4` not the
number four. Notice, for example, that `[1-20]` does **not** mean 1
through 20, it means the characters 1 through 2 or the character 0. So
`[1-20]` simply means the character class composed of 0, 1, and 2.

Keep in mind that characters do have an order and the digits do follow
the numeric order. So `0` comes before `1` which comes before `2` and so
on. For the same reason, we can define lower case letters as `[a-z]`,
upper case letters as `[A-Z]`, and `[a-zA-z]` as both.

Notice that `\w` is equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`.

What if we want a match when we have exactly 1 digit? This will be
useful in our case study since feet are never more than 1 digit so a
restriction will help us. One way to do this with regex is by using
*anchors*, which let us define patterns that must start or end at a
specific place. The two most common anchors are `^` and `$` which
represent the beginning and end of a string, respectively. So the
pattern `^\\d$` is read as "start of the string followed by one digit
followed by end of string".

This pattern now only detects the strings with exactly one digit:

```{r eval = FALSE}
pattern <- "^\\d$"
yes <- c("1", "5", "9")
no <- c("12", "123", " 1", "a4", "b")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_view(s, pattern, match = NA)
```

![](img/str_view-4.png){width="80%"}


The ` 1` does not match because it does not start with the digit but
rather with a space, which is not easy to see.

### Bounded quantifiers

For the inches part, we can have one or two digits. This can be
specified in regex with *quantifiers*. This is done by following the
pattern with curly brackets containing the number of times the previous
entry can be repeated. We call the *bounded* because the numbers in the
quantifier are limited by the numbers in the curly brackets. Later we
learn about *unbounded quantifiers*.

We use an example to illustrate. The pattern for one or two digits is:

```{r eval = FALSE}
pattern <- "^\\d{1,2}$"
yes <- c("1", "5", "9", "12")
no <- c("123", "a4", "b")
str_view(c(yes, no), pattern, match = NA)
```

![](img/str_view-5.png){width="80%"}

In this case, `123` does **not** match, but `12` does. To look for
our feet and inches pattern, we can add the symbols for feet `'` and
inches `"` after the digits.

With what we have learned, we can now construct an example for the
pattern `x'y"` with `x` feet and `y` inches.

```{r}
pattern <- "^[4-7]'\\d{1,2}\"$"
```

The pattern is now getting complex, but you can look at it carefully and
break it down:

-   `^` = start of the string
-   `[4-7]` = one digit, either 4,5,6 or 7
-   `'` = feet symbol
-   `\\d{1,2}` = one or two digits
-   `\"` = inches symbol
-   `$` = end of the string

Let's test it out:

```{r}
yes <- c("5'7\"", "6'2\"",  "5'12\"")
no <- c("6,2\"", "6.2\"","I am 5'11\"", "3'2\"", "64")
str_detect(yes, pattern)
str_detect(no, pattern)
```

For now, we are permitting the inches to be 12 or larger. We will add a
restriction later as the regex for this is a bit more complex than we
are ready to show.

### White space `\s`

Another problem we have is spaces. For example, our pattern does not
match `5' 4"` because there is a space between `'` and `4` which our
pattern does not permit. Spaces are characters and R does not ignore
them:

```{r}
identical("Hi", "Hi ")
```

In regex, `\s` represents white space. To find patterns like `5' 4`, we
can change our pattern to:

```{r}
pattern_2 <- "^[4-7]'\\s\\d{1,2}\"$"
str_subset(problems, pattern_2)
```

However, this will not match the patterns with no space. So do we need
more than one regex pattern? It turns out we can use a quantifier for
this as well.

### Unbounded quantifiers: `*`, `?`, `+`

We want the pattern to permit spaces but not require them. Even if there
are several spaces, like in this example `5'   4`, we still want it to
match. There is a quantifier for exactly this purpose. In regex, the
character `*` means zero or more instances of the previous character.
Here is an example:

```{r}
yes <- c("AB", "A1B", "A11B", "A111B", "A1111B")
no <- c("A2B", "A21B")
str_detect(yes, "A1*B")
str_detect(no, "A1*B")
```

The above matches the first string which has zero 1s and all the strings
with one or more 1s. We can then improve our pattern by adding the `*`
after the space character `\s`.

There are two other similar quantifiers. For none or once, we can use
`?`, and for one or more, we can use `+`. You can see how they differ
with this example:

```{r}
data.frame(string = c("AB", "A1B", "A11B", "A111B", "A1111B"),
           none_or_more = str_detect(yes, "A1*B"),
           nore_or_once = str_detect(yes, "A1?B"),
           once_or_more = str_detect(yes, "A1+B"))
```

We will actually use all three in our reported heights example, but we
will see these in a later section.

### Not

To specify patterns that we do **not** want to detect, we can use the
`^` symbol but only **inside** square brackets. Remember that outside
the square bracket `^` means the start of the string. So, for example,
if we want to detect digits that are preceded by anything except a
letter we can do the following:

```{r}
pattern <- "[^a-zA-Z]\\d"
yes <- c(".3", "+2", "-0","*4")
no <- c("A3", "B2", "C0", "E4")
str_detect(yes, pattern)
str_detect(no, pattern)
```

Another way to generate a pattern that searches for *everything except*
is to use the upper case of the special character. For example `\\D`
means anything other than a digit, `\\S` means anything except a space,
and so on.

### Groups {#sec-groups}

*Groups* are a powerful aspect of regex that permits the extraction of
values. Groups are defined using parentheses. They don't affect the
pattern matching per se. Instead, it permits tools to identify specific
parts of the pattern so we can extract them.

We want to change heights written like `5.6` to `5'6`.

To avoid changing patterns such as `70.2`, we will require that the
first digit be between 4 and 7 `[4-7]` and that the second be none or
more digits `\\d*`. Let's start by defining a simple pattern that
matches this:

```{r}
pattern_without_groups <- "^[4-7],\\d*$"
```

We want to extract the digits so we can then form the new version using
a period. These are our two groups, so we encapsulate them with
parentheses:

```{r}
pattern_with_groups <-  "^([4-7]),(\\d*)$"
```

We encapsulate the part of the pattern that matches the parts we want to
keep for later use. Adding groups does not affect the detection, since
it only signals that we want to save what is captured by the groups.
Note that both patterns return the same result when using `str_detect`:

```{r}
yes <- c("5,9", "5,11", "6,", "6,1")
no <- c("5'9", ",", "2,8", "6.1.1")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_detect(s, pattern_without_groups)
str_detect(s, pattern_with_groups)
```

Once we define groups, we can use the function `str_match` to extract
the values these groups define:

```{r}
str_match(s, pattern_with_groups)
```

Notice that the second and third columns contain feet and inches,
respectively. The first column is the part of the string matching the
pattern. If no match occurred, we see an `NA`.

Now we can understand the difference between the functions `str_extract`
and `str_match`. `str_extract` extracts only strings that match a
pattern, not the values defined by groups:

```{r}
str_extract(s, pattern_with_groups)
```



### Search and replace

Earlier we defined the object `problems` containing the strings that do
not appear to be in inches. We can see that not too many of our
problematic strings match the pattern:

```{r}
pattern <- "^[4-7]'\\d{1,2}\"$"
sum(str_detect(problems, pattern))
```

To see why this is, we show some examples that expose why we don't have
more matches:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
problems[c(2, 10, 11, 12, 15)] |> str_view(pattern)
```

![](img/str_view-6.png){width="80%"}

An initial problem we see immediately is that some students wrote out
the words "feet" and "inches". We can see the entries that did this with
the `str_subset` function:

```{r}
str_subset(problems, "inches")
```

We also see that some entries used two single quotes `''` instead of a
double quote `"`.

```{r}
str_subset(problems, "''")
```

To correct this, we can replace the different ways of representing
inches and feet with a uniform symbol. We will use `'` for feet, whereas
for inches we will simply not use a symbol since some entries were of
the form `x'y`. Now, if we no longer use the inches symbol, we have to
change our pattern accordingly:

```{r}
pattern <- "^[4-7]'\\d{1,2}$"
```

If we do this replacement before the matching, we get many more matches:

```{r}
problems |> 
  str_replace("feet|ft|foot", "'") |> # replace feet, ft, foot with ' 
  str_replace("inches|in|''|\"", "") |> # remove all inches symbols
  str_detect(pattern) |> 
  sum()
```

However, we still have many cases to go.

Note that in the code above, we leveraged the **stringr** consistency
and used the pipe.

For now, we improve our pattern by adding `\\s*` in front of and after
the feet symbol `'` to permit space between the feet symbol and the
numbers. Now we match a few more entries:

```{r}
pattern <- "^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*\\d{1,2}$"
problems |> 
  str_replace("feet|ft|foot", "'") |> # replace feet, ft, foot with ' 
  str_replace("inches|in|''|\"", "") |> # remove all inches symbols
  str_detect(pattern) |> 
  sum()
```

We might be tempted to avoid doing this by removing all the spaces with
`str_replace_all`. However, when doing such an operation we need to make
sure that it does not have unintended effects. In our reported heights
examples, this will be a problem because some entries are of the form
`x y` with space separating the feet from the inches. If we remove all
spaces, we will incorrectly turn `x y` into `xy` which implies that a
`6 1` would become `61` inches instead of `73` inches.

The second large type of problematic entries were of the form `x.y`,
`x,y` and `x y`. We want to change all these to our common format `x'y`.
But we can't just do a search and replace because we would change values
such as `70.5` into `70'5`. Our strategy will therefore be to search for
a very specific pattern that assures us feet and inches are being
provided and then, for those that match, replace appropriately.

### Search and replace using groups

Another powerful aspect of groups is that you can refer to the extracted
values in a regex when searching and replacing.

The regex special character for the `i`-th group is `\\i`. So `\\1` is
the value extracted from the first group, `\\2` the value from the
second and so on. As a simple example, note that the following code will
replace a comma with period, but only if it is after a digit between 4 and 7, and followed by zero or more digits:

```{r}
pattern_with_groups <-  "^([4-7]),(\\d*)$"
yes <- c("5,9", "5,11", "6,", "6,1")
no <- c("5'9", ",", "2,8", "6.1.1")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_replace(s, pattern_with_groups, "\\1'\\2")
```

We can use this to convert cases in our reported heights.

We are now ready to define a pattern that helps us convert all the
`x.y`, `x,y` and `x y` to our preferred format. We need to adapt
`pattern_with_groups` to be a bit more flexible and capture all the
cases.

```{r}
pattern_with_groups <- "^([4-7])\\s*[,\\.\\s+]\\s*(\\d*)$"
```

Let's break this one down:

-   `^` = start of the string
-   `[4-7]` = one digit representing feet, either 4, 5, 6, or 7
-   `\\s*` = none or more white space
-   `[,\\.\\s+]` = feet and inches are separated by either `,`, `.` or at least one space
-   `\\s*` = none or more white space
-   `\\d*` = none or more digits representing inches
-   `$` = end of the string

We can see that it appears to be working:

```{r}
str_subset(problems, pattern_with_groups) |> head()
```

and will be able to perform the search and replace:

```{r}
str_subset(problems, pattern_with_groups) |> 
  str_replace(pattern_with_groups, "\\1'\\2") |> head()
```

Again, we will deal with the inches-larger-than-twelve challenge later.

### Lookarounds

Lookarounds provide a way to ask for one or more conditions to be
satisfied without moving the search forward or matching it. For example,
you might want to check for multiple conditions and if they are matched,
then return the pattern or part of the pattern that matched.

There are four types of lookarounds: lookahead `(?=pattern)`, lookbehind
`(?<=pattern)`, negative lookahead `(?!pattern)`, and negative
lookbehind `(?<!pattern)`.

The conventional example checking password that must satisfy several
conditions such as 1) 8-16 word characters, 2) starts with a letter, and
3) has at least one digit. You can concatenate lookarounds to check for
multiple conditions. For our example we can write

```{r}
pattern <- "(?=\\w{8,16})(?=^[a-z|A-Z].*)(?=.*\\d+.*)"
```

A simpler example is changing all `superman` to `supergirl` without
changing all the men to girl. We could use a lookaround like this:

```{r}
s <- "Superman saved a man. The man thanked superman."
str_replace_all(s, "(?<=[Ss]uper)man", "girl")
```

### Separating variables {#sec-separate_regex}

In @sec-separate we introduced functions that can split columns into new ones. The `separate_wider_regex` uses regex instead of delimiters to separate variables in data frames. It uses an approach similar to regex groups and turns each of groups into a new column. 

Suppose we have data frame like this:

```{r}
tab <- data.frame(x = c("5'10", "6' 1", "5 ' 9", "5'11\""))
```

Note that using `separate_wider_delim` won't work here because the delimiter can varies across entries. With `separate_wider_regex` we can define flexible patterns that are matched to define each column. 

```{r}
patterns <- c(feet = "\\d", "\\s*'\\s*", inches = "\\d{1,2}", ".*")
tab |> separate_wider_regex(x, patterns = patterns)
```

By not naming the second and fourth entries of `patterns` we tell the function not to keep the values that match that pattern. 

## Trimming

In general, spaces at the start or end of the string are uninformative.
These can be particularly deceptive because sometimes they can be hard
to see:

```{r}
s <- "Hi "
cat(s)
identical(s, "Hi")
```

This is a general enough problem that there is a function dedicated to
removing them: `str_trim`.

```{r}
str_trim("5 ' 9 ")
```


## Case conversion 

Notice that regex is case sensitive. Often we want to match a word
regardless of case. One approach to doing this is to first change
everything to lower case and then proceeding ignoring case. As an
example, note that one of the entries writes out numbers as words
`Five foot eight inches`. Although not efficient, we could add 13 extra
`str_replace` calls to convert `zero` to `0`, `one` to `1`, and so on.
To avoid having to write two separate operations for `Zero` and `zero`,
`One` and `one`, etc., we can use the `str_to_lower` function to make
all works lower case first:

```{r}
s <- c("Five feet eight inches")
str_to_lower(s)
```

Other related functions are `str_to_upper` and `str_to_title`. We are
now ready to define a procedure that converts all the problematic cases
to inches.

## Case study 1: Putting it all together

We are now ready to put it all together and wrangle our reported heights data to try to recover as many heights as possible. The code is complex, but we will break it down into parts.

Let's see how many problematic entries we can recover with the approaches we covered in @sec-regex. We will first define a function that detects entries that are not reported as inches or centimeters:

```{r}
not_inches_or_cm <- function(x, smallest = 50, tallest = 84){
  inches <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(x))
  is.na(inches) |
    !((inches >= smallest & inches <= tallest) |
        (inches/2.54 >= smallest & inches/2.54 <= tallest))
}
```

We can see how many entries are not inches or centimeters:

```{r}
problems <- reported_heights |> 
  filter(not_inches_or_cm(height)) |>
  pull(height)
length(problems)
```

Let's see how many feet`'`inches format we can recover applying the finding from @sec-regex. Specifically we replace feet/foot/ft with `'`, we remove the word inches and its abbreviations, then rewrite similar patterns into the desired feet`'`inches pattern. Once this is done we see what proportion don't fit the desired pattern

```{r}
converted <- problems |> 
  str_replace("feet|foot|ft", "'") |> 
  str_remove_all("inches|in|''|\"") |>  
  str_replace("^([4-7])\\s*[,\\.\\s+]\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1'\\2") 
index <- str_detect(converted, "^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*\\d{1,2}$")
mean(!index)
```

We see that a substantial proportion has not yet been fixed. Trial and error is a common approach to finding the regex pattern that satisfies all desired conditions. We can examine the remaining cases to try to decipher if new patterns we can use to fix them:

```{r}
converted[!index]
```


We noticed that two students added `cm` and some entries have space at the end so we write incorporate this into our cleanup stage. We also notice that at least one entry wrote out numbers such as `Five foot eight inches`. We can use  the `words()` function in the **english** package to change these to actual numbers. In preparation for our final product, we define a function that cleans up previously noticed problems and these new ones:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(english)
cleanup <- function(s){
  s <- str_remove_all(s, "inches|in|''|\"|cm|and") |> 
    str_trim() |>
    str_to_lower()
  for (i in 0:11){
    s <- str_replace_all(s, words(i), as.character(i))
  }
  return(s)
}
```

Many also notice that students measuring exactly 5 or 6 feet did not enter any inches, for example `6'`, and our pattern requires that inches be included, and that some entries are in meters and some of these use European decimals, for example `1.6` and `1,70`. So we 
create a function that add these corrections to those already identified as needed to reformat the entry as feet`'`inches:

```{r}
convert_format <- function(s){
  s |> str_replace("feet|foot|ft", "'") |> 
    str_replace("^([4-7])\\s*[,\\.\\s+]\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1'\\2") |> 
    str_replace("^([56])'?$", "\\1'0") |> 
    str_replace("^([12])\\s*,\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1\\.\\2")
}
```

Now we are ready to wrangle our reported heights dataset. The strategy is as follows: 

1\. We start by defining a variable to keep a copy of the original entry, we then clean up and covert the `height` entry using the functions described above. 

2\. We then use the `separate_wider_regex_` function to extract feet and inches when the entry matches our feet`'`inches format. 

3\. We use a lookaround to make sure that entries that have numbers with no `'` following them don't match and return an `NA`. 

4.\ Once this is done, we convert the feet and inches into inches.

5.\ Finally, we decide if the entries are in inches, centimeters, or meters and convert appropriately.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
patterns <- c(feet = "[4-7](?=\\s*'\\s*)", 
              "\\s*'\\s*", 
              inches = "\\d+\\.?\\d*")
smallest <- 50
tallest <- 84
new_heights <- reported_heights |> 
  mutate(original = height, 
         height = convert_format(cleanup(height))) |>
  separate_wider_regex(height, patterns = patterns, 
                       too_few = "align_start", 
                       cols_remove = FALSE) |> 
  mutate(across(c(height, feet, inches), as.numeric)) |>
  mutate(guess = 12 * feet + inches) |>
  mutate(height = case_when(
    is.na(height) ~ as.numeric(NA),
    between(height, smallest, tallest) ~ height,  #inches
    between(height/2.54, smallest, tallest) ~ height/2.54, #cm
    between(height*100/2.54, smallest, tallest) ~ height*100/2.54, #meters
    TRUE ~ as.numeric(NA))) |>
  mutate(height = ifelse(is.na(height) & 
                           inches <= 12 & between(guess, smallest, tallest),
                         guess, height)) |>
  select(-feet, -inches, -guess)
```

We see that we fix all but `r sum(is.na(new_heights$height))` entries. You can see that these are mostly un-fixable:

```{r}
new_heights |> filter(is.na(height)) |> pull(original)
```

You can review the ones we did fix by typing:

```{r}
#| eval: false
new_heights |>
  filter(not_inches_or_cm(original)) |>
  select(original, height) |> 
  arrange(height) |>
  View()
```

A final observation is that if we look at the shortest students in our course:

```{r}
new_heights |> arrange(height) |> head(n = 6)
```

We see heights of 50, 51, 52, and so on. These short heights are rare and it is likely that the students actually meant 5'0,  5'1, 5'2 and so on. Because we are not completely sure, we will leave them as reported. The object new_heights contains our final solution for this case study.




## Case study 3: extracting tables from a PDF

One of the datasets provided in **dslabs** shows scientific funding
rates by gender in the Netherlands:

```{r}
library(dslabs)
research_funding_rates |> 
  select("discipline", "success_rates_men", "success_rates_women")
```

The data comes from a paper published in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Science (PNAS)[^string-processing-5], a widely read
scientific journal. However, the data is not provided in a spreadsheet;
it is in a table in a PDF document. Here is a screenshot of the table:

[^string-processing-5]: <http://www.pnas.org/content/112/40/12349.abstract>

![](img/pnas-table-s1.png)

(Source: Romy van der Lee and Naomi Ellemers, PNAS 2015 112 (40)
12349-12353[^string-processing-6].)

[^string-processing-6]: <http://www.pnas.org/content/112/40/12349>

We could extract the numbers by hand, but this could lead to human
error. Instead, we can try to wrangle the data using R. We start by
downloading the pdf document, then importing into R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("pdftools")
temp_file <- tempfile()
url <- paste0("https://web.archive.org/web/20150927033124/",
              "https://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2015/09/16/",
              "1510159112.DCSupplemental/pnas.201510159SI.pdf")
download.file(url, temp_file)
txt <- pdf_text(temp_file)
file.remove(temp_file)
```

If we examine the object text, we notice that it is a character vector
with an entry for each page. So we keep the page we want:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
raw_data_research_funding_rates <- txt[2]
```

The steps above can actually be skipped because we include this raw data in the **dslabs** package as well. 

Examining the object `raw_data_research_funding_rates` we see that it is a long string and each line on the page, including the table rows, are separated by the symbol for newline: `\n`. A first step in converting this into a data frame is to store rows separately in a way that will make them easy to access. For this we use the `str_split` function:

```{r}
tab <- str_split(raw_data_research_funding_rates, "\n")
```

Because we start off with just one string, we end up with a list with just one entry.

```{r}
tab <- tab[[1]]
```

By examining `tab` we see that the information for the column names is
the third and fourth entries:

```{r}
the_names_1 <- tab[3]
the_names_2 <- tab[4]
```

The first of these rows looks like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(substr(the_names_1, 1, options()$width))
cat(substr(the_names_1, options()$width, nchar(the_names_1)))
```

We want to create one vector with one name for each column. Using some
of the functions we have just learned, we do this. 

Let's start with
`the_names_1`, shown above. We want to remove the leading space and
anything following the comma. We use regex for the latter. Then we can
obtain the elements by splitting strings separated by space. We want to split only when there are 2 or more spaces to avoid splitting
`Success rates`. So we use the regex `\\s{2,}`

```{r}
the_names_1 <- the_names_1 |>
  str_trim() |>
  str_replace_all(",\\s.", "") |>
  str_split("\\s{2,}", simplify = TRUE)
the_names_1 
```

Now we will look at `the_names_2`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(substr(the_names_2, 1, options()$width))
cat(substr(the_names_2, options()$width, nchar(the_names_2)))
```

Here we want to trim the leading space and then split by space as we did
for the first line:

```{r}
the_names_2 <- the_names_2 |>
  str_trim() |>
  str_split("\\s+", simplify = TRUE)
the_names_2
```

We can then join these to generate one name for each column:

```{r}
tmp_names <- paste(rep(the_names_1, each = 3), the_names_2[-1], sep = "_")
the_names <- c(the_names_2[1], tmp_names) |>
  str_to_lower() |>
  str_replace_all("\\s", "_")
the_names
```

Now we are ready to get the actual data. By examining the `tab` object,
we notice that the information is in lines 6 through 14. We can use
`str_split` again to achieve our goal:

```{r}
new_research_funding_rates <- tab[6:14] |>
  str_trim() |>
  str_split("\\s{2,}", simplify = TRUE) |>
  data.frame() |>
  setNames(the_names) |>
  mutate(across(-1, parse_number))
new_research_funding_rates |> as_tibble()
```

We can see that the objects are identical:

```{r}
identical(research_funding_rates, new_research_funding_rates)
```

## Renaming levels {#sec-recode}

Another common operation involving strings is renaming the levels of  of a categorical variables. Let's say you have really long names for your levels. If you will be displaying them in plots, you might want to use shorter versions of these names. For example, in character vectors with country names, you might want to change "United States of America" to "USA" and "United Kingdom" to UK, and so on. 

Rather than changing each entry, a more efficient approach is to change the levels. 


Here is an example that shows how to rename countries with long names:

```{r}
library(dslabs)
```

Suppose we want to show life expectancy time series by country for the
Caribbean. If we make this plot

```{r caribbean}
gapminder |> 
  filter(region == "Caribbean") |>
  ggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy, color = country)) +
  geom_line()
```

we see that the legend takes up much of the plot because we have four countries with names longer than 12 characters. We can rename these levels using the `case_when` function:

```{r}
x <- levels(gapminder$country)
levels(gapminder$country) <- case_when(
  x == "Antigua and Barbuda" ~ "Barbuda",
  x == "Dominican Republic" ~ "DR",
  x == "St. Vincent and the Grenadines" ~ "St. Vincent",
  x == "Trinidad and Tobago" ~ "Trinidad",
  .default = x)
gapminder |> 
  filter(region == "Caribbean") |>
  ggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy, color = country)) +
  geom_line()

```

We can instead use the `fct_recode` function in the **forcats** package:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(forcats)
gapminder$country <- 
  fct_recode(gapminder$country, 
             "Barbuda" = "Antigua and Barbuda",
             "DR" = "Dominican Republic",
             "St. Vincent" = "St. Vincent and the Grenadines",
             "Trinidad" = "Trinidad and Tobago")
```

## Exercises

1\. Complete all lessons and exercises in the RegexOne^[<https://regexone.com/>]
online interactive tutorial.

2\. In the `extdata` directory of the **dslabs** package, you will find
a PDF file containing daily mortality data for Puerto Rico from Jan 1,
2015 to May 31, 2018. You can find the file like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fn <- system.file("extdata", "RD-Mortality-Report_2015-18-180531.pdf",
                  package="dslabs")
```

Find and open the file or open it directly from RStudio. On a Mac, you
can type:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
system2("open", args = fn)
```

and on Windows, you can type:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
system("cmd.exe", input = paste("start", fn))
```

Which of the following best describes this file:

a.  It is a table. Extracting the data will be easy.
b.  It is a report written in prose. Extracting the data will be
    impossible.
c.  It is a report combining graphs and tables. Extracting the data
    seems possible.
d.  It shows graphs of the data. Extracting the data will be difficult.

3\. We are going to create a tidy dataset with each row representing one
observation. The variables in this dataset will be year, month, day, and
deaths. Start by installing and loading the **pdftools** package:

```{r, eval= FALSE}
install.packages("pdftools")
library(pdftools)
```

Now read-in `fn` using the `pdf_text` function and store the results in
an object called `txt`. Which of the following best describes what you
see in `txt`?

a.  A table with the mortality data.
b.  A character string of length 12. Each entry represents the text in
    each page. The mortality data is in there somewhere.
c.  A character string with one entry containing all the information in
    the PDF file.
d.  An html document.

4\. Extract the ninth page of the PDF file from the object `txt`, then
use the `str_split` from the **stringr** package so that you have each
line in a different entry. Call this string vector `s`. Then look at the
result and choose the one that best describes what you see.

a.  It is an empty string.
b.  I can see the figure shown in page 1.
c.  It is a tidy table.
d.  I can see the table! But there is a bunch of other stuff we need to
    get rid of.

5\. What kind of object is `s` and how many entries does it have?

6\. We see that the output is a list with one component. Redefine `s` to
be the first entry of the list. What kind of object is `s` and how many
entries does it have?

7\. When inspecting the string we obtained above, we see a common
problem: white space before and after the other characters. Trimming is
a common first step in string processing. These extra spaces will
eventually make splitting the strings hard so we start by removing them.
We learned about the command `str_trim` that removes spaces at the start
or end of the strings. Use this function to trim `s`.

8\. We want to extract the numbers from the strings stored in `s`.
However, there are many non-numeric characters that will get in the way.
We can remove these, but before doing this we want to preserve the
string with the column header, which includes the month abbreviation.
Use the `str_which` function to find the rows with a header. Save these
results to `header_index`. Hint: find the first string that matches the
pattern `2015` using the `str_which` function.

9\. Now we are going to define two objects: `month` will store the month
and `header` will store the column names. Identify which row contains
the header of the table. Save the content of the row into an object
called `header`, then use `str_split` to help define the two objects we
need. Hints: the separator here is one or more spaces. Also, consider
using the `simplify` argument.

10\. Notice that towards the end of the page you see a *totals* row
followed by rows with other summary statistics. Create an object called
`tail_index` with the index of the *totals* entry.

11\. Because our PDF page includes graphs with numbers, some of our rows
have just one number (from the y-axis of the plot). Use the `str_count`
function to create an object `n` with the number of numbers in each each
row. Hint: you can write a regex for number like this `\\d+`.

12\. We are now ready to remove entries from rows that we know we don't
need. The entry `header_index` and everything before it should be
removed. Entries for which `n` is 1 should also be removed, and the
entry `tail_index` and everything that comes after it should be removed
as well.

13\. Now we are ready to remove all the non-numeric entries. Do this
using regex and the `str_remove_all` function. Hint: remember that in
regex, using the upper case version of a special character usually means
the opposite. So `\\D` means "not a digit". Remember you also want to
keep spaces.

14\. To convert the strings into a table, use the `str_split_fixed`
function. Convert `s` into a data matrix with just the day and death
count data. Hints: note that the separator is one or more spaces. Make
the argument `n` a value that limits the number of columns to the values
in the 4 columns and the last column captures all the extra stuff. Then
keep only the first four columns.

15\. Now you are almost ready to finish. Add column names to the matrix,
including one called `day`. Also, add a column with the month. Call the
resulting object `dat`. Finally, make sure the day is an integer not a
character. Hint: use only the first five columns.

16\. Now finish it up by tidying `tab` with the `pivot_longer`
function.

17\. Make a plot of deaths versus day with color to denote year. Exclude
2018 since we do not have data for the entire year.

18\. Now that we have wrangled this data step-by-step, put it all
together in one R chunk, using the pipe as much as possible. Hint: first
define the indexes, then write one line of code that does all the string
processing.

19\. Advanced: let's return to the MLB Payroll example from the web
scraping section. Use what you have learned in the web scraping and
string processing chapters to extract the payroll for the New York
Yankees, Boston Red Sox, and Oakland A's and plot them as a function of
time.
