# Importing data {#sec-importing-data}

We have been using datasets already stored as R objects. In data analysis work we rarely have such luck and will have to import data into R from either a file, a database, or another source. Currently, one of the most common ways of storing and sharing data for analysis is through electronic spreadsheets. A spreadsheet stores data in rows and columns. It is basically a file version of a data frame. When saving such a table to a computer file, one needs a way to define when a new row or column ends and the other begins. This in turn defines the cells in which single values are stored. Here is an example of what a comma separated file looks like if we open it with a basic text editor:


![](img/csv-file.png)

In this chapter, we outline how to load data from a file into R. First, it's crucial to identify the file's location; thus, we touch on file paths and working directories (detailed in @sec-unix). Next, we delve into file types (text or binary) and encodings (like ASCII and Unicode), both essential for data import. We then introduce popular functions for data importing, referred to as _parsers_. Lastly, we offer tips on how to store data in spreadsheets. Advanced topics like extracting data from websites or PDFs will be discussed in the book's Data Wrangling section.

## Paths and the working directory 

The first step when importing data from a spreadsheet is to locate the file containing the data. Although we do not recommend it, you can use an approach similar to what you do to open files in Microsoft Excel by clicking on the RStudio "File" menu, clicking "Import Dataset", then clicking through folders until you find the file. However, we write code rather than use the point-and-click approach. The key concepts we need to learn to do this are described in detail in @sec-unix. Here we provide an overview of the very basics.


### The filesystem

You can think of your computer's filesystem as a series of nested folders, each containing other folders and files.  We refer to folders as _directories_. We refer to the folder that contains all other folders as the _root directory_. We refer to the directory in which we are currently located as the _working directory_. The working directory therefore changes as you move through folders: think of it as your current location. 


### Relative and full paths

The _path_ of a file is a list of directory names that can be thought of as instructions on what folders to click on, and in what order, to find the file. If these instructions are for finding the file from the root directory, we refer to it as the _full path_. If the instructions are for finding the file starting in the working directory, we refer to it as a _relative path_. @sec-filesystem provides more details on this topic.

To see an example of a full path on your system type the following:

```{r}
system.file(package = "dslabs")
```

Note that the output will be different across different computers. The `system.file` function finds the full path to the files that were added to your system when you installed the __dslabs__ package. The strings separated by slashes are the directory names. The first slash represents the root directory and we know this is a full path because it starts with a slash. 

We can use the function `list.files` to show the names of files and directories in any directory. For example, here are the files in the **dslabs** package directory:

```{r}
dir <- system.file(package = "dslabs")
list.files(dir)
```

Note that these do not start with slash which implies they are _relative paths_. These relative paths give us the location of the files or directories if the path stored in `dir` is our working directory. 

:::{.callout-note} 
You will not make much use of the `system.file` function in your day-to-day data analysis work. We introduce it in this section because it facilitates the sharing of spreadsheets that can be used to practice. The spreadsheets are in the `extdata` directory. 
:::

### The working directory

We highly recommend only using relative paths in your code. The reason is that full paths are unique to your computer and you want your code to be portable. If you want to know  the full path of your working directory using the `getwd` function. If you need to change your working directory, you can use the function `setwd` or you can change it through RStudio by clicking on "Session". 

When you start a project you want to pick a directory to store all the files related to that project and make this is your working directory when ruining your analysis. This will facilitate th because if you provide a relative path to an importing functions, it will assume you want R to search for this file in the working directory. @sec-projects provides details on how to organize projects with RStudio.


### Generating path names

The `file.path` function combines characters to form a complete path, ensuring compatibility with the respective operating system. Linux and Mac use forward slashes `/`, while Windows uses backslashes `\`, to separate directories. This function is useful because often you want to define paths using a variable. Here is an example that constructs the full path for a spreadsheet containing the murders data. Here the variable `dir` contains the full path for the __dslabs__ package and `extdata/murders.csv` is the relative path of the spreadsheet if `dir` is considered the working directory.

```{r}
#| cache: false
dir <- system.file(package = "dslabs")
file_path <- file.path(dir, "extdata/murders.csv")
```

You can copy the file with full path `file_path` to your working directory using the function `file.copy`:

```{r}
#| cache: false
file.copy(file_path, "murders.csv")
```

If the file is copied successfully, this function will return `TRUE`. 
Note that we used the same filename for the destination file, but we can give it whatever name we want. If a file with that name already exists in your destination directory, the copy will be unsuccessful. You can change this behavior with the `overwrite` argument.

## File types

For most data analysis applications, files can generally be classified into two categories: text files  and binary files. In this section we describe the most widely used format for both these types and the best way to identify them. In the last subsection we describe the importance of knowing the file encoding.

:::{.callout-note}
For this and the following section we assume you have copied the `murders.csv` file into your working directory. You can use the code at the end of the previous section to do this.
:::

### Text files 

You have already worked with text files. All your R scripts and Quarto files, for example, are text files and so are the Quarto files used to create this book. The `murders.csv` file mentioned above is also text files. One big advantage of these files is that we can easily "look" at them without having to purchase any kind of special software or follow complicated instructions. Any text editor can be used to examine a text file, including freely available editors such as RStudio or nano. To see this, try opening a csv file using the "Open file" RStudio tool. You should be able to see the content right on your editor. 

When text files are used to store a spreadsheet, line breaks are used to separate rows and a predefined character, referred to as the _delimiter_, is used to separate columns within a row. The most common delimiters are comma (`,`), semicolon (`;`), space (` `), and tab (a preset number of spaces or `\t`). Slightly different approaches are used to read these files into R, so we need to know what delimiter was used. In some cases, the delimiter can be inferred from file suffix. For example, files ending in `csv` or `tsv` are expected to be comma and tab delimited, respectively. However, it is harder to infer the delimiter for files ending in `txt`. As a result we recommend looking at the file rather than inferring from the suffix. You can look at any number of lines from within R using the `readLines` function:

```{r}
readLines("murders.csv", n = 3)
```

This immediately reveals that the file is indeed comma delimited. It also reveals that the file has a header: the first row contains column names rather than data. This is also important to know. Most parsers assume the file starts with a header, but not all files have one.

### Binary files

Opening image files such as jpg or png in a text editor or using `readLines` in R will not show comprehensible content because these are _binary_ files. Unlike text files, which are designed for human readability and have standardized conventions, binary files can adopt numerous formats specific to their data type. While R's `readBin` function can process any binary file, interpreting the output necessitates a thorough understanding of the file's structure. This intricate topic isn't covered in this book. Instead, we concentrate on the prevalent binary formats for spreadsheets: Microsoft Excel's xls and xlsx.


### Encoding

A frequent issue when importing data, whether text or binary, is incorrectly identifying the file's _encoding_. 
At its core, a computer translates everything into sequences of 0s and 1s. ASCII is an _encoding_ system that assigns specific numbers to characters. Using 7 bits, ASCII can represent $2^7 = 128$ unique symbols, sufficient for all English keyboard characters. However, many global languages contain characters outside ASCII's range. For instance, the é in "México" isn't in ASCII's catalog. To address this, broader encodings, such as Unicode, emerged. Unicode offers variations using 8, 16, or 32 bits, known as UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32. RStudio typically uses UTF-8 as its default. Notably, ASCII is a subset of UTF-8, meaning that if a file is ASCII-encoded, presuming it's UTF-8 encoded won't cause issues. However, there other encodings, such as ISO-8859-1 (also known as Latin-1) developed for the western European languages, Big5 for Traditional Chinese, and ISO-8859-6 for Arabic.

The __dslabs__ package includes a file that is not UTF-8 encoded to serve as an example. Notice the strange characters that appear you attempt to read in the first line:

```{r}
#| cache: false
fn <- "calificaciones.csv"
file.copy(file.path(system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs"), fn), fn)
readLines(fn, n = 1)
```

In the following section, we'll introduce several helpful import functions, some of which allow you to specify the file encoding.

## Parsers

Importing functions, or parsers, are available from base R. However, more powerful and often faster functions are available in the __readr__, __readxl__, and __data.table__ packages. In this section we review some examples. We also describe how data can be downloaded or read directly from the internet.

### Base R

Base R provides several file parsers for example `read.csv`, `read.table` and `read.delim`. The first argument can take either a full or relative path. If a relative path is provided, the parser assumes you want to search in the working directory. Therefore, to read the `murders.csv` file previously copied to our working directory, we can simply type:

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("murders.csv")
```

An often useful R-base importing function is `scan`, as it provides much flexibility. When reading in spreadsheets many things can go wrong. The file might have multiline headers or be missing cells. With experience you will learn how to deal with different challenges. Carefully reading the help files for the functions discussed here will be useful. With scan you can read-in each cell of a file. Here is an example:

```{r}
x <- scan("murders.csv", sep = ",", what = "c")
x[1:10]
```


### readr {#sec-reader}

The __readr__ package includes parsers, for reading text file spreadsheets into R. __readr__ is part of the __tidyverse__, but you can load it directly using:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr)
```


The following functions are available to read-in text file spreadsheets:

| Function  | Format                                           | Typical suffix |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------| 
| read_table| white space separated values | txt |
| read_csv | comma separated values |  csv |
| read_csv2 | semicolon separated values | csv |
| read_tsv | tab delimited separated values | tsv |
| read_delim | general text file format, must define delimiter | txt |

It also includes `read_lines` with similar functionality to `readLines`.

We can read in the `murders.csv` file using

```{r}
dat <- read_csv("murders.csv")
```

Note that we receive a message letting us know what data types were used for each column. Also note that `dat` is a `tibble`, not just a data frame. We can suppress this message using the argument `show_col_types = FALSE`.

The __readr__ parsers permit us to specify an encoding. It also includes a function that tries to guess the encoding:

```{r}
guess_encoding("murders.csv")
```

This function can help us read the file we previously noted was showing strange characters:

```{r}
guess_encoding("calificaciones.csv")
```

Once we know the encoding we can specify it through the `locale` argument:

```{r}
dat <- read_csv("calificaciones.csv", show_col_types = FALSE,
                locale = locale(encoding = "ISO-8859-1"))
```

We learn about locales in @sec-locales.

We can now see that the characters in the header were read in correctly:

```{r}
names(dat)
```


### readxl


The __readxl__ package provides functions to read-in Microsoft Excel formats.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)
```

The main functions are:

| Function  | Format                                           | Typical suffix |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------| 
| read_excel | auto detect the format | xls, xlsx|
| read_xls | original format |  xls |
| read_xlsx | new format | xlsx |

The Microsoft Excel formats permit you to have more than one spreadsheet in one file. These are referred to as _sheets_. The functions listed above read the first sheet by default, but we can also read the others. The `excel_sheets` function gives us the names of all the sheets in an Excel file. These names can then be passed to the `sheet` argument in the three functions above to read sheets other than the first.

### data.table

The __data.table__ package provides the `fread` function, a powerful and fast utility designed for reading large datasets. `fread` automatically detects the format of the input, whether it's delimited text or even files compressed in formats like gzip or zip. It offers a significant speed advantage over the other parsers described here, especially for large files. 

```{r}
library(data.table)
dat <- fread("murders.csv")
```

Note `fread` returns a `data.table` object.


### Downloading files

A common place for data to reside is on the internet. When these data are in files, we can download them and then import them or even read them directly from the web. For example, we note that because our __dslabs__ package is on GitHub, the file we downloaded with the package has a url:

```{r}
url <- paste0("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/",
              "rafalab/dslabs/master/inst/extdata/murders.csv")
```

Most parsers can read these files directly:

```{r, message = FALSE}
dat <- read.csv(url)
```

If you want to have a local copy of the file, you can use the `download.file` function: 

```{r}
download.file(url, "murders.csv")
```

This will download the file and save it on your system with the name `murders.csv`. You can use any name here, not necessarily `murders.csv`.

:::{.callout-warning}
The function `download.file` overwrites existing files without warning.
:::

Two functions that are sometimes useful when downloading data from the internet are `tempdir` and `tempfile`. The first creates a directory with a random name that is very likely to be unique. Similarly, `tempfile` creates a character string, not a file, that is likely to be a unique filename. So you can run a command like this which erases the temporary file once it imports the data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tmp_filename <- tempfile()
download.file(url, tmp_filename)
dat <- read_csv(tmp_filename)
file.remove(tmp_filename)
```



## Organizing data with spreadsheets

Although this book focuses almost exclusively on data analysis, data management is also an important part of data science operations. As explained in the introduction, we do not cover this topic. However, quite often data analysts need to collect data, or work with others collecting data, in a way that is most conveniently stored in a spreadsheet. Although filling out a spreadsheet by hand is a practice we highly discourage, and we instead recommend the process be automatized as much as possible, sometimes you just have to do it. Therefore, in this section, we provide recommendations on how to organize data in a spreadsheet. Although there are R packages designed to read Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, we generally want to avoid this format. Instead, we recommend Google Sheets as a free software tool. Below 
we summarize the recommendations made in paper by Karl Broman and Kara Woo^[<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989>]. Please read the paper for important details.

* __Be Consistent__ - Before you commence entering data, have a plan. Once you have a plan, be consistent and stick to it. 
* __Choose Good Names for Things__ - You want the names you pick for objects, files, and directories to be memorable, easy to spell, and descriptive. This is actually a hard balance to achieve and it does require time and thought. One important rule to follow is **do not use spaces**, use underscores `_` or dashes instead `-`. Also, avoid symbols; stick to letters and numbers.
* __Write Dates as YYYY-MM-DD__ -  To avoid confusion, we strongly recommend using this global ISO 8601 standard.
* __No Empty Cells__ - Fill in all cells and use some common code for missing data. 
* __Put Just One Thing in a Cell__ - It is better to add columns to store the extra information rather than having more than one piece of information in one cell.
* __Make It a Rectangle__ - The spreadsheet should be a rectangle. 
* __Create a Data Dictionary__ - If you need to explain things, such as what the columns are or what the labels used for categorical variables are, do this in a separate file.
* __No Calculations in the Raw Data Files__ - Excel permits you to perform calculations. Do not make this part of your spreadsheet. Code for calculations should be in a script.
* __Do Not Use Font Color or Highlighting as Data__ - Most import functions are not able to import this information. Encode this information as a variable instead.
* __Make Backups__ - Make regular backups of your data. 
* __Use Data Validation to Avoid Errors__ - Leverage the tools in your spreadsheet software so that the process is as error-free and repetitive-stress-injury-free as possible. 
* __Save the Data as Text Files__ - Save files for sharing in comma or tab delimited format.
    
## Exercises 

1\. Use the `read_csv` function to read each of the files that the following code saves in the `files` object: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
path <- system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs")
files <- list.files(path)
files
```

  
2\. Note that the the `olive` file, gives us a warning. This is because the first line of the file is missing the header for the first column. 

Read the help file for `read_csv` to figure out how to read in the file without reading this header. If you skip the header, you should not get this warning. Save the result to an object called `dat`.

  
3\. A problem with the previous approach is that we don't know what the columns represent. Type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
names(dat)
```

to see that the names are not informative.

Use the `readLines` function to read in just the first line. 

4\. Pick a measurement you can take on a regular basis. For example, your daily weight or how long it takes you to run 5 miles. Keep a spreadsheet that includes the date, the hour, the measurement, and any other informative variable you think is worth keeping. Do this for 2 weeks. Then make a plot.


```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
tmp <- file.remove("murders.csv")
tmp <- file.remove("calificaciones.csv")
```
